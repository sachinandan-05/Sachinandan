## How It Works

### Upload Flow

1. **User selects image** in admin dashboard
2. **Preview shows** immediately (using FileReader)
3. **File is uploaded** to `/api/upload` endpoint
4. **API converts** file to buffer
5. **Cloudinary receives** and processes image
6. **Secure URL returned** to frontend
7. **URL saved** to form state
8. **On form submit**, URL saved to MongoDB

### Architecture

```
