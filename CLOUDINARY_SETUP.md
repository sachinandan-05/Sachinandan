## Cloudinary Dashboard

Access your Cloudinary dashboard to:
- View all uploaded images
- Organize images in folders
- Get image URLs
- Apply transformations
- Monitor usage

## Troubleshooting

### Images not uploading?

1. **Check environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Make sure all three are set in .env
   echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
   echo $CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
   echo $CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
   ```

2. **Restart the server** after changing .env
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check browser console** for error messages

4. **Verify credentials** in Cloudinary dashboard

### Upload fails with "Invalid credentials"?

- Double-check your API Key and API Secret
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in .env
- Cloud Name should be without `https://` or any URL parts

### Image preview not showing?

- Check if the image uploaded successfully (look in Cloudinary dashboard)
- Verify the secure_url is being saved to your database
- Check browser console for CORS errors

## Free Tier Limits

Cloudinary free tier includes:
- 25 GB Storage
- 25 GB Bandwidth per month
- Up to 25,000 transformations per month
- 2 users

This is more than enough for a personal portfolio!

## Alternative: Keep Using URL Input

If you prefer not to use Cloudinary, you can still:
1. Host images anywhere (GitHub, Imgur, etc.)
2. Manually paste URLs in the admin dashboard
3. The image input fields accept both uploaded images and direct URLs

## Benefits of Cloudinary

âœ… **Automatic optimization** - Images are compressed and served in optimal format
âœ… **CDN delivery** - Fast loading from anywhere in the world
âœ… **Transformations** - Resize, crop, and format images on-the-fly
âœ… **Backup** - Your images are safely stored in the cloud
âœ… **Easy management** - View and organize all your images in one place

## Next Steps

1. Sign up for Cloudinary (if not done)
2. Update your .env with credentials
3. Restart the dev server
4. Go to `/admin` and try uploading an image!
5. Deploy to production (add env vars to Vercel)

Enjoy your new image upload feature! ðŸŽ‰
